# ShieldOS-dev

Working on ShieldOS, a decentralized personal security operating system on Solana.

ShieldOS focuses on encrypted mail, storage, password management, private messaging, and security-focused AI inside a single dashboard.  
Wallet-based authentication only, no Web2-style accounts.

## Current Scope

- ShieldOS core architecture and dashboard  
- Solana wallet integration and auth flows  
- Encrypted modules for mail, drive, and vault  
- Identity and permission layer design  
- Security and threat modeling

## Design Principles

- Privacy-first by default  
- Minimal and auditable system design  
- Strong cryptography with clear rationale  
- No telemetry, no tracking, no data selling
